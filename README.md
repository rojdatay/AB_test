 AB Testing: Comparison of Facebook Bidding Methods
 in terms of the Number of Products Sold after Clicks

 Facebook bidding allows advertisers to set the amount they are willing to pay for their ads to reach their
 target audience through an auction-based system.

 # Business Problem
 Facebook introduced a new bidding type called "average bidding" as an alternative to the existing "maximum bidding"
 type. In this study, the statistical significance of any differences in the number of product purchases made by
 customers after clicking on ads will be examined, based on the utilization of these bidding methods.
